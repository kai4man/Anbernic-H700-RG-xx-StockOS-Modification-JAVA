**How to Play Java Games on 35xxPlus & 35xxH**

### Steps:

1. Copy the **Emu** and **JAVA** directories to the root of the SD card. The _Emu_ folder must be placed in TF1.
2. Place the game in a folder named "JAVA" according to the screen size (either 240x320 or 320x240)
   ~240x320 (portrait mode)
   ~320x240 (landscape mode)
   _Make sure the Java game file is in .jar format_
3. Go to the application center on the home screen and enable **Expert Mode**. After that, navigate to the **JAVA** directory on the SD card and you'll be able to open and play Java games.
